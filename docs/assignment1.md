# Personal information
### I am Elina Antonova, s1057069, first-year Comouting Science student.
I am 22-years-old and I moved to Nijmegen in 2020 from Tallinn, Estonia, where I used to live my whole life. I have graduated from Tallinn University of Technology in 2020 with Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Cum Laude). During the last year at the university I was working as C# developer in Bait Partner, but had to quit when moving here. I am following Computing Science bachelor course, because I am interested to study Software Science Master's course.

I was doing figure skating for 8 years until I quit in 2012. Currently I am interested in pole dancing, however, with all corona regulations it is now impossible to do it. I am also a member of Lasya (pole dance) sport association and active Thalia member (First-year committee).
